## Setup Instructions

###  Backend (Flask)Ôºö
Flask server will run at: http://127.0.0.1:5050


```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
###  Frontend (React)Ôºö
React app will run at: http://localhost:3000   
Submits POST request to: http://localhost:5050/api/submit
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
## ‚è± Time Spent

| Task                      | Estimated | Actual |
|---------------------------|-----------|--------|
| Backend (API + DB)        | 1.5 hr    | 1.5 hr |
| Frontend (React Form)     | 1.5 hr    | 2 hr   |
| Debugging (CORS + Ports)  | 0.5 hr    | 2 hr   |
| Testing + Cleanup         | 0.5 hr    | 0.5 hr |
| **Total**                 | ~4 hrs    | ~6 hrs |

## Why this tech stack?
React offers fast UI prototyping and is industry standard.

Flask is lightweight and ideal for small RESTful services.

SQLite is perfect for local development and simplicity.

Axios + Flask + CORS allow smooth integration with modern frontends.

## Challenges & Solutions
1. CORS Preflight Errors (403)
Issue: Browser blocked POST request from React (localhost:3000) to Flask (localhost:5000).

Fix:

Installed and used flask-cors

Replaced CORS(app, origins=...) with CORS(app) for development flexibility

2. Port 5000 conflict (macOS)
Issue: Port 5000 was used by macOS system service (ControlCenter, AirPlay), Flask never received the request.

Fix:

Switched backend to port 5050

Updated frontend axios URL accordingly
